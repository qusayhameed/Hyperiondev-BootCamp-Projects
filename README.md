'''
# This is Capstone Project for a financial calculation of an interest based on user input
# Explain to the user what words to enter to calculate the interest wether it is an investment or bond
# Ask the user to enter investment or bond and convert whatever a word entered to small letter using lower() function
# if user entered investment : ask the user to choose either simple or compound interest
# ask the user of what is the current interest rate and how much amount deposited as well as the number of years 
# base on what user entered earlier if simple/compound then use the right equation calculate the total money
  will be gained in that period and the interest rate applied and exit from the loop
# if user entered earlier the bond word then ask for the current value of the house and the current interest rate 
  and the number of the months needed then calculate the interest that will be applied using the given equation
  and display the amount then exit the loop 
# following the first request from user to enter a word either investment or bond, if any other words 
  entered print a text asking the customer to enter the right word.
